### Generating function
* For the sequence $(a_n)$ depending on $n$, find the generating function $f(x)$ which generates $(a_n)$
* For a particular / arbitrary $n$, find the coefficent $a_n$ of the $x^n$ in the generating unction $f(x)$. 
Then determine the sequence $(a_n)$ generated by $f(x)$
* For positive integers $r, n$, construct a generating function $f(x)$ that counts the number of ways to divide $r$ similar objects into $n$ boxes, such that the number of objects in the boxes satisfy the given conditions.
* For a positive integer $n$, construct the generating function that counts the number of summands / partitions of $n$ satisfying the given conditions

### Exponential generating function
* For the sequence $(a_n)$ depending on $n$, find the exponential generating function $f(x)$ which generates $(a_n)$
* For a particular / arbitrary $n$, find the coefficent $a_n$ of the $x^n$ in the exponential generating function $f(x)$.
Then determine the sequence $(a_n)$ generated by the exponential generating function $f(x)$
* Let $n$ objects including $n_i$ similar objects of type $i$, for $i = 1, 2,\ldots, r$. 
For a given $k$ ($0 < k \le n$), build the exponential function that counts the number of ways to arrange $k$ objects drawn from these $n$ objects.
